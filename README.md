# ACM-inductions
My name is Paarth Singh, ID number- 2024AAPS0317H
I coud'nt complete the induction tasks as i always ran into some problem
1) i coud'nt use the openai api as i needed to add credit to my open ai account which i was ready to do but didn't have a credit card
2) i downloaded all of llama3.1 on my computer it was working fine till yesterday, now when i am trying to use it, it starts trying to download something again
3) i then tried it through hugging face but that also needed a lot of downloading/cloning and midway through that i exhausted my data limit for the day
i am still submitting this cause why not, and to show that i tried and also my dedication,patience (everything i downloaded was through bits wifi as my ethernet does'nt work).
(btw the video you guys gave in resources also does'nt work as it also uses openai, the syntax is old and the code is also giving some error)
